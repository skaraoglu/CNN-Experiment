In this part of our project, we focused on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Following information is taken from the corresponding assignment's website: https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~ppoupart/teaching/cs480-fall20/assignments.html.

In this assignment, you will experiment with fully connected neural networks and convolutional neural networks, using the Keras open source package. Keras is one of the simplest deep learning packages that serves as a wrapper on top of TensorFlow. Preliminary steps:

- Familiarize yourself with Keras. Click on "Guides" and read the first two guides: "The functional API" and "The Sequential Model".
- Download and install Keras on a machine with a GPU or use Google's Colaboratory environment, which allows you to run Keras code on a GPU in the cloud. Colab already has Keras pre-installed. To enable GPU acceleration, click on "edit", then "notebook settings" and select "GPU" for hardware acceleration. It is also possible to select "TPU", but the Keras code provided with this assignment will need to be modified in a non-trivial way to take advantage of TPU acceleration.
- Download the base code for this assignment: assignment jupyter file\footnote{https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~ppoupart/teaching/cs480-fall20/assignments/asst4/cs480\_fall20\_asst4\_cnn\_cifar10.ipynb}.

Answer the following questions by modifying the base code in assignment jupyter file. Submit the modified Jupyter notebook via LEARN.
